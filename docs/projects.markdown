### Datapacks
![Minecraft DnD](/assets/projects/minecraft-dnd.png)  
This was the first datapack that I've made, and definitely the one I'm nmost proud of. It currently adds all major/minor species from DnD to Minecraft, each one giving unique stats and abilities. I created it on December 8th, 2024.

This is a small pack I made for the Summer 2025 Datapack Jam on Planet Minecraft. It's not very good, but I enjoyed making it and learned some new things along the way. I created it on June 14th, 2025, and it ranked 10th place (out of 10) in the jam.

### Other
#### Random Skin Generator
This is a little python script I made for fun that generates a random Minecraft skin each time you run it. None of the skins it makes are good, but theoretically it can make any single layer skin in existence.
