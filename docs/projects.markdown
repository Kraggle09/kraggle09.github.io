## Datapacks
![Minecraft DnD](/assets/projects/minecraft-dnd.png)  
This was the first datapack that I've made, and definitely the one I'm most proud of. It currently adds all major/minor species from DnD to Minecraft, each one giving unique stats and abilities. I first released it on December 8th, 2024.

![DogPlus](/assets/projects/dogplus.png)  
This is a small pack I made for the Summer 2025 Datapack Jam on Planet Minecraft. It's not very good, but I enjoyed making it and learned some new things along the way. I first released it on June 14th, 2025, and it ranked 10th place (out of 10) in the jam.

![Call the Animals](/assets/projects/call-the-animals.png)  
This is a small pack that increases the tempt range for all animals to 2048, which is pretty cool to watch. It was also the first time I spent a decent amount of effort on the cover image, and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. I first released it on July 12th, 2025.

**Random Skin Generator**  
This is a little python script I made for fun that generates a random Minecraft skin each time you run it. None of the skins it makes are good, but theoretically it can make any single layer skin in existence.
