This is a collection of great guides, generators, or other cool stuff I've found on the internet. All of these are free (or offer substantial free content), and I've personally used all of them at least a few times.

# Minecraft
## Misc
**[Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki)**  
The definitive resource for all Minecraft information. (Not to be confused with the Fandom wiki, which is horrible and should be avoided at all costs)  

**[Planet Minecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/)**  
Online repository of tons of skins, resource packs, datapacks, maps, mods, and more.  

## Development
**[Datapack Wiki](https://datapack.wiki/)**  
A wiki about datapacks in Minecraft, including documentation and guides.  

**[Misode Datapack Generators](https://misode.github.io/)**  
Generators for lots of files in datapacks.  

**[Text Editor](https://text.datapackhub.net/)**  
A text formatting editor for Minecraft commands and datapacks.  

**[Custom Model Data Guide](https://github.com/Simplexity-Development/Custom_Model_Data_Guide)**  
A guide for custom model data in datapacks. I used this for [dogplus](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/dogplus/).  

**[bedrock.dev](https://bedrock.dev/)**  
Documentation on Bedrock addons and resource packs.  

**[Bedrock Wiki](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/)**  
Guides on developing addons and resource packs for Bedrock Minecraft  


# Coding
**[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)**  
Offers lessons on programming for free. They have mini-guides that you can do in an afternoon, or full courses that you can do over several months. I've used them for learning several languages.  

**[Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/)**  
Guides on developing for Apple platforms.  

**[Markdown Live Preview](https://markdownlivepreview.com/)**  
A great tool to preview markdown code (I use the term code lightly).
