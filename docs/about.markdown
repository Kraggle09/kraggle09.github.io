## FAQ

### Podcast
**Why haven’t you published an episode this week**  
Sometimes I will miss a week, which can be due to a lot of things. Lack of motivation, life events, etc.  
**Can I be on an episode?**  
There are a lot of reasons why I’m not open to collaborations with my viewers, unless they specifically make their own content (podcast, YouTube, etc). At that point, it’d depend on more factors.  
**Is the podcast family friendly?**  
Yes, the podcast should be fine for general audiences.  
**You say the podcast is video, but I only see audio.**  
Video versions of episodes are exclusive to Spotify.  

### Server
**Why can’t I join the server?**  
This could be due to a lot of things. The server might be offline, you might have typed in the IP incorrectly, or your client version might be different than the server version.  
**Can you update the server?**  
If a new update just came out, I usually wait at least a few weeks for all my plugins to update. If you’re on Java, you can just launch an older version. Bedrock usually is compatible with older versions, but new content won’t be available until the server updates.  
**Can I have Admin?**  
Right now I’m not accepting admin applications.  
**Does the server have Creative mode enabled?**  
The server is survival only.  
**Can you help me build a base?**  
No, because it’d be unfair to those who aren’t online when I am. Plus I have creative mode, so it’d difficult to figure out where to draw the line.  
**Can you join the server?**  
I plan to make a schedule for what times I’ll be on the server. For now, just assume I’m not available to join.  

### Miscellaneous
**Can you friend/follow me on [platform]?**  
I only friend people I know decently well, because I don’t want my friends list to be cluttered up with every single listener.  
**Do you have a YouTube channel?**  
Not at this time, no.  
**Can you make a YouTube channel?**  
No. You can stop asking now.  
**Can you come onto my podcast/channel?**  
Email me if you want me to appear on an episode, and I’ll decide depending on your content.  
**Can you play Minecraft with me?**  
Asides from the server, I typically don’t play with listeners.
