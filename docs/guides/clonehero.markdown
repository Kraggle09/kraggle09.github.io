## What is Clone Hero?
Clone Hero is, as the name may suggest, a clone of Guitar Hero for PC. If you don't know, Guitar Hero was a rhythm-based game where you'd play a guitar along-side the music.

## Why use Clone Hero instead of Guitar Hero, Rock Band, or Fortnite Festival?
Guitar Hero Live was discontinued in 2018, meaning you can no play new songs on it, and are limited to the original 42 games. This also applies to older entries.

Rock Band 4 was a great option, but as of January 2024, they've stopped released weekly songs.

Fortnite Festival is rather new, and while it's still updated, you're still limited to the songs that Epic has added to the game.

Clone Hero allows you to load on your own songs (including custom charts), use legacy hardware (I'm using the Guitar Hero 5 Wii controller), and just offers more control.

## What about YARG?
YARG (short for Yet Another Rhythem Game) has more features on paper, and is open source, but has a few issues that prevent me from playing it:
- No matter how much I try, I get incredible controller latency on YARG. It makes it unplayable.
- YARG feels less polished.
- I like the graphics of Clone Hero more.

That said, it's still being updated frequently, while Clone Hero has all but ceased development (1.1 will come out soon, and they have a sequel planned, but it's a long ways off). If YARG gets more polished (and the latency is fixed), I may very well make the switch.
