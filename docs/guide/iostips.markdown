# iOS Tips and Tricks

## Music
**Ambient Music (iOS 18.4+)**  
To access free background music (even without Apple Music) from control center, first go to edit mode (by holding down in empty space or pressing the plus icon in the top left corner), then click "Add a Control". Scroll down a little bit, and you'll see an Ambient Music section with 4 controls (Sleep, Chill, Productivity, and Wellbeing). Choose one of the controls, and move it as needed. Then tap the new button (while still in edit mode), and you'll see 4 playlists you can choose from. Here's a list of all the available playlists and their associated buttons.

| Sleep Playlists | Chill Playlists | Productivity Playlists | Wellbeing Playlists |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Ambient Bedtime | Laidback Lo-Fi | Momentum Beats | Calm Piano |
| Restful Notes | Ambient Unwind | Ambient Focus | Ambient Meditation |
| Lo-Fi Snooze | Easy Electronic | Lo-Fi Study | Rhythem & Breath |
| Dream Journey | Mellow Piano | Piano Flow | Serenity Sounds |

## Misc
**Reduce White Point**  
If you've ever turned on your phone at night, you've probably tried to reduce the brightness, only to realize it's already all the way down. However, there is an accessibility setting called "Reduce White Point", which will turn your brightness down even farther. You can access it in Settings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size, or you can add a Control Center toggle for quick access.
