Welcome to my guide on Python! I've been coding in Python since late 2019, and I think I am at a level now where I can teach others how to use it themselves.

## About this course
This course will teach you the basics (and intermediates) of Python. It's meant to be a starting point for you to get to grips with Python. You can follow it in order (recommended for beginners) or jump around (see the [table of contents](/python/toc/)).

## What you will need
You will need a PC. Windows is recommended, and will be the platform used here, but most of the stuff in this guide should work on MacOS and Linux. There are mobile versions of Python, but I can't guarantee that they will work 100% with this guide.

## Skill requirement
You need to at least know the basics of using a PC. File management, command line usage, etc.

## Resources
Each lesson has code snippets that you can copy and paste, but I recommend typing them out yourself (helps you remember it better).

You can view the full code for each lesson [here](https://github.io/kraggle09/python-tutorial-files).

## This course is still in development, so if you find any issues with it please let me know
