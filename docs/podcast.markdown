# Redstone Weekly - A Minecraft Podcast

## About the show
Redstone weekly is (as the title may suggest) a Minecraft podcast. I cover the latest news, play Minecraft, and generally just talk about Minecraft.

## Brief history
I created the show in November 2019, and uploaded the first episode January 2020. Since then, I've steadily released episodes, and as of this page's writing, I've made 110 episodes.

## Some quick specs
**Schedule:** I sorta upload weekly, but right now it's just whenever I feel like it.  
**Seasons:** 3  
**Episodes:** 110  
**Time:** November 2019-Present
