# Preamble
## Background
If you're like me, you probably first saw AI as this neat, almost magical thing. Maybe you messed around with ChatGPT, and thought, "Oh this is neat!". But the more you learned about AI, and saw it plastered everywhere on ads, you've probably gone from 'this is neat' to 'ew get this out of my face'. I know I have.

The issue is, I kinda got used to using AI (specifically chatbots) for things that I normally used google for. Or just my own brain.

So over the past half year or so, I've been working on cutting back on generative AI usage. I never really used ai images, music, or videos, but I definitely have used chatgpt for a lot of things. But I'm working on cutting back on that. And hopefully, with this guide, you can too.


## I want to make X, but I don't know how!
There's a simple solution:

**LEARN IT**

Just learn how to do the thing! You are lucky enough to live in a time where all of the world's knowledge and information is at your fingertips. If you don't know how to do something, just learn it! Whether it's a google search, or youtube video, or \**gasp\** a physical, *real* book, you can *easily* learn how to do something. Yes it's not as easy as putting a prompt into ChatGPT or dall-E, but I assure you, you'll feel more fulfilled and more satisfied with the end result.

The purpose of this page is to be a repository of various guides on how to do things, so you won't need to use AI for anything.
